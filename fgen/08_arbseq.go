# Section 8 IviFgenArbSeq Extension Group

## Section 8.1 IviFgenArbSeq Overview

The IviFgenArbSeq extension group supports function generators capable of
producing sequences of arbitrary waveforms. In order to support this extension,
a driver must first support the IviFgenArbWfm extension group. This extension
uses the IviFgenArbWfm extension groupâ€™s attributes of sample rate, gain, and
offset to configure a sequence. The IviFgenArbSeq extension group includes
functions for creating, configuring, and generating sequences, and for
returning information about arbitrary sequence creation.

This extension affects instrument behavior when the Output Mode attribute is
set to Output Sequence.


## Section 8.2 IviFgenArbSeq Attributes

Below are the .NET attributes, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

| Section | Attribute        | Type   | Access | AppliesTo |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
|   8.2.1 | Arb Seq Handle   | Int32  | R/W    | Channel   |
|   8.2.2 | Num Seq Max      | Int32  | RO     | N/A       |
|   8.2.3 | Loop Count Max   | Int32  | RO     | N/A       |
|   8.2.4 | Seq Length Max   | Int32  | RO     | N/A       |
|   8.2.5 | Seq Length Min   | Int32  | RO     | N/A       |


## Section 8.3 IviFgenArbSeq Functions

Below are the .NET functions, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

8.3.1 void Arbitrary.ClearMemory ();
8.3.2 void Arbitrary.Sequence.Clear (Int32 handle);
8.3.3 void Arbitrary.Sequence.Configure (String channelName,
                                         Int32 handle,
                                         Double gain,
                                         Double offset);
8.3.4 Int32 Arbitrary.Sequence.Create (Int32[] waveformHandle,
                                       Int32[] loopCount);
