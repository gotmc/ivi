# Section 7 IviFgenArbFrequency Extension Group

## Section 7.1 IviFgenArbFrequency Overview

The IviFgenArbFrequency extension group supports function generators capable of
producing arbitrary waveforms that allow the user to set the rate at which an
entire waveform buffer is generated. In order to support this extension, a
driver must first support the IviFgenArbWfm extension group. This extension
uses the IviFgenArbWfm extension groupâ€™s attributes of Arbitrary Waveform
Handle, Arbitrary Gain, and Arbitrary Offset to configure an arbitrary
waveform.

This extension affects instrument behavior when the Output Mode attribute is
set to Output Arbitrary.


## Section 7.2 IviFgenArbFrequency Attributes

Below are the .NET attributes, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

| Section | Attribute        | Type   | Access | AppliesTo |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
|   7.2.1 | Arbitrary Freq   | Real64 | R/W    | Channel   |


## Section 7.3 IviFgenArbFrequency Functions

Below are the .NET functions, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

None.
