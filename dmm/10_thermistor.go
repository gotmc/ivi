# Section 10 IviDmmThermistor Capability Group

## Section 10.1 IviDmmThermistor Overview

The IviDmmThermistor extension group supports DMMs that take temperature
measurements using a thermistor transducer type.

The IviDmm class assumes that you are using an interchangeable thermistor.
Interchangeable thermistors are thermistors that exhibit similar behavior for a
given resistance value.

## Section 10.2 IviDmmThermistor Attributes

Below are the .NET attributes, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

| Section | Attribute               | Type     | Access | AppliesTo |
| ------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ------ | --------- |
|  10.2.1 | Thermistor Resistance   | Real64   | R/W    | N/A       |

## Section 10.3 IviDmmThermistor Functions

Below are the .NET functions, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

None.
