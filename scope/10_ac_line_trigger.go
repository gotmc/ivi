# Section 10 IviScopeAcLineTrigger Extension Group

## Section 10.1 IviScopeAcLineTrigger Overview

In addition to the fundamental capabilities, the IviScopeAcLineTrigger
extension group defines extensions for oscilloscopes that are capable of
synchronizing the trigger with the AC Line.

AC Line triggering occurs when the oscilloscope detects a positive zero
crossing, negative zero crossing, or optionally either positive or negative
zero crossing on the network supply voltage.


## Section 10.2 IviScopeAcLineTrigger Attributes

Below are the .NET attributes, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

| ------- | ---------------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
|  10.2.1 | AC Line Trigger Slope  | Int32    | R/W    | N/A         |

## Section 10.3 IviScopeAcLineTrigger Functions

Below are the .NET functions, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.
