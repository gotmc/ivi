# Section 5 IviScopeInterpolation Extension Group

## Section 5.1 IviScopeInterpolation Overview

The IviScopeInterpolation extension group defines extensions for oscilloscopes
capable of interpolating values in the waveform record that the oscilloscopeâ€™s
acquisition sub-system was unable to digitize.


## Section 5.2 IviScopeInterpolation Attributes

Below are the .NET attributes, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

| Section | Attribute              | Type     | Access | AppliesTo   |
| ------- | ---------------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |

## Section 5.3 IviScopeInterpolation Functions

Below are the .NET functions, since they are the basis for the Go interfaces.

None.
